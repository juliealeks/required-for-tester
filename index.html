     <h2><p><strong><em>QA testing is one of the areas of information technology, aimed at improving the quality of a software product or Internet project. After the official release, the program must work flawlessly, accurately and quickly. If you do not identify all the errors as much as possible before the release, you can pay with your reputation. There are no perfect apps, but you can make them as perfect as possible with QA testing.</em></strong></p></h2>

        The tasks of the tester have little in common with the tasks of the programmer. Analysis of requirements, drawing up a test plan taking into account the coverage of requirements, performing manual testing and launching autotests, preparing reports - this is the job of a tester. If you do not consider the level of simple manual testing that such work has a much greater analytical component than a technical one. Product validation requires a sufficiently wide outlook from the tester, since you have to look at the product through the eyes of the user and understand his needs. You have to be able to “be a user” and know his needs, which is not easy when it comes to specialized solutions. You need to know the industry standards that the solution must comply with, and be able to verify this compliance. You need to be able to find ways to test compatibility with competitive solutions.
        It also requires a different mindset from the tester. The developer's way of thinking should lead him to one correct and optimal scenario for solving the problem. The tester's way of thinking leads him to a variety of scenarios, of which, by definition, there are more.
