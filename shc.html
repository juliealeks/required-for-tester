  <div><i><li>SQL is an acronym for Structured Query Language.SQL was specifically designed to interact with databases. Unlike other languages (colloquial, such as English, or programming languages, such as Java or Visual Basic), SQL consists of only a few words. And this was done intentionally. SQL was designed to do one thing that it does well â€” to provide a simple and efficient way to read and write information to a database.</li>
    
    <div><li>The database software is called the database management system (DBMS).Database is a repository created and managed by a DBMS. Users never access the database directly, they always use the DBMS to access it.</li></div>
    <div>
    <li>A table is a structured file that can store data of a particular type. The table can contain a list of customers, a product catalog, and any other information.</li></div>
    <div>
    <li>The key point is that the data stored in the table must be of the same type, or taken from the same list. Never store your customer list and order list in the same database table. This makes it difficult to find and retrieve information. Better to create two tables for each of the lists. Each table in the database has a unique name that identifies it, and no other table in the database can have the same name.</li></div>

<div><em><p><font color="darkslategray"><strong><u>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</p>
<p> Cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the bodywill also get the same color (unless you specify something else)! This is why CSS saves a lot of work: it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</p>
<p>With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and more.</font></p></em></strong></u></div>
